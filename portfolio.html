                        Ever since I remember, I disliked coding and also believed that it was not my cup of coffee(as I prefer coffee to tea).
                        I developed this feeling of dislike and fear as I often heard people say it's very hard to code. 
                        But, I always had great admiration for people who do programming.
                        Even though I was good at Academics and always had an option to choose Computer Science as my major, I picked up a different major(Electronics).
                        That fear of coding continued throughout my college years and even after landing a job.
                        Luckily or unluckily, my job profile(BI Developer) needed very little or no knowledge of programming.

                     Years passed but the guilt of leaving something unexplored bothered me. Though everything was good, I wasn't completely satisfied with my professional career.
                    I felt a need to change the direction my career was headed towards and take up something that is challenging enough for me.
                    After giving it a serious thought, I felt that it is time to overcome my fears. I was determined to learn Web development and started off with designing web-pages using HTML & CSS.
                    That's how I kick-started my coding journey which eventually led me into programming and Responsive Web-designing. 
                    Learning Javascript was my next venture; this was the one which gave me a taste of what coding is all about.
                    And, there was no looking back! I completely enjoy coding now and it has become an integral  part of my life. 
                    And I din't stop it there, as now I am a front-end web developer using HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, JS & CSS Frameworks, MySQL, MongoDB and much more.
                    I am also ever-ready to learn new technologies/languages/frameworks/libraries that make me a better developer.
